# Finding Donors For Charity Using Supervised Algorithms

In this project, I have employed several supervised algorithmsto accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. The goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000.

The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article "Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid". You can find the article by Ron Kohavi online. The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the 'fnlwgt' feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Python (verison-2.6)
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries used: pandas, numpy, sklearn

### Installing

To install libraries, use pip command.

Example:

```
pip install pandas
```
### Running

To run the project, clone the repository and run the .ipynb file.

```
jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```
